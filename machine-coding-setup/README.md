### Machine Coding Setup

#### Data Structure
`User: {
  id,
  name,
  email,
  gender,
  status
}`

#### Featues covered
* API calls via `fetch` module
* Used `lodash` module via CDN
* Used `localstorage` to persist data
* Used pagination to handle long list of data
* Debouncing on search by name


#### Tips
* Write the structure of the data recieved via API in local file to avoid keep looking back and forth
* Revise DOM APIs
* Put cherry on top kind of features like debouncing, caching, pagination.
